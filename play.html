<pre>
    <p>ACT I.

        SCENE I.--ARMANDE, HENRIETTE.</p>
    
    <h3 class="tri">TRI.</h3> <p class="speech">Much is expected from your enlightened knowledge, for nature has
        hidden few things from you.</p>
    
    <h3 class="phi">PHI.</h3> <p class="speech">For my part, I have, without boasting, already made one
        discovery; I have plainly seen men in the moon.</p>
    
    <h3 class="bel">BEL.</h3> <p class="speech">I have not, I believe, as yet quite distinguished men, but I have
        seen steeples as plainly as I see you. [Footnote: An astronomer of the
        day had boasted of having done this.]</p>
    
    <h3 class="arm">ARM.</h3> <p class="speech">In addition to natural philosophy, we will dive into grammar,
        history, verse, ethics, and politics.</p>
    
    <h3 class="phi">PHI.</h3> <p class="speech">I find in ethics charms which delight my heart; it was formerly
        the admiration of great geniuses; but I give the preference to the
        Stoics, and I think nothing so grand as their founder.</p>
    
    <h3 class="arm">ARM.</h3> <p class="speech">Our regulations in respect to language will soon be known, and
        we mean to create a revolution. Through a just or natural antipathy,
        we have each of us taken a mortal hatred to certain words, both verbs
        and nouns, and these we mutually abandon to each other. We are
        preparing sentences of death against them, we shall open our learned
        meetings by the proscription of the diverse words of which we mean to
        purge both prose and verse.</p>
    
    <h3 class="phi">PHI.</h3> <p class="speech">But the greatest project of our assembly--a noble enterprise
        which transports me with joy, a glorious design which will be approved
        by all the lofty geniuses of posterity--is the cutting out of all
        those filthy syllables which, in the finest words, are a source of
        scandal: those eternal jests of the fools of all times; those nauseous
        commonplaces of wretched buffoons; those sources of infamous
        ambiguity, with which the purity of women is insulted.</p>
    
    <h3 class="tri">TRI.</h3> <p class="speech">These are indeed admirable projects.</p>
    
    <h3 class="bel">BEL.</h3> <p class="speech">You shall see our regulations when they are quite ready.</p>
    
    <h3 class="tri">TRI</h3> <p class="speech">They cannot fail to be wise and beautiful.</p>
