<pre>TRI. Much is expected from your enlightened knowledge, for nature has
    hidden few things from you.
    
    PHI. For my part, I have, without boasting, already made one
    discovery; I have plainly seen men in the moon.
    
    BEL. I have not, I believe, as yet quite distinguished men, but I have
    seen steeples as plainly as I see you. [Footnote: An astronomer of the
    day had boasted of having done this.]
    
    ARM. In addition to natural philosophy, we will dive into grammar,
    history, verse, ethics, and politics.
    
    PHI. I find in ethics charms which delight my heart; it was formerly
    the admiration of great geniuses; but I give the preference to the
    Stoics, and I think nothing so grand as their founder.
    
    ARM. Our regulations in respect to language will soon be known, and
    we mean to create a revolution. Through a just or natural antipathy,
    we have each of us taken a mortal hatred to certain words, both verbs
    and nouns, and these we mutually abandon to each other. We are
    preparing sentences of death against them, we shall open our learned
    meetings by the proscription of the diverse words of which we mean to
    purge both prose and verse.
    
    PHI. But the greatest project of our assembly--a noble enterprise
    which transports me with joy, a glorious design which will be approved
    by all the lofty geniuses of posterity--is the cutting out of all
    those filthy syllables which, in the finest words, are a source of
    scandal: those eternal jests of the fools of all times; those nauseous
    commonplaces of wretched buffoons; those sources of infamous
    ambiguity, with which the purity of women is insulted.
    
    TRI. These are indeed admirable projects.
    
    BEL. You shall see our regulations when they are quite ready.
    
    TRI. They cannot fail to be wise and beautiful.
    
    ARM. We shall by our laws be the judges of all works; by our laws,
    prose and verse will both alike be submitted to us. No one will have
    wit except us or our friends. We shall try to find fault with
    everything, and esteem no one capable of writing but ourselves.
    
    
    
    
    SCENE III--PHILAMINTE, BÉLISE, ARMANDE, HENRIETTE, TRISSOTIN, LÉPINE.
    
    LEP. (_to_ TRISSOTIN). Sir, there is a gentleman who wants to
    speak to you; he is dressed all in black, and speaks in a soft tone.
    (_They all rise._)
    
    TRI. It is that learned friend who entreated me so much to procure him
    the honour of your acquaintance.
    
    PHI. You have our full leave to present him to us.   (TRISSOTIN
    _goes out to meet_ VADIUS.)
    
    
    
    
    SCENE IV.--PHILAMINTE, BÉLISE, ARMANDE, HENRIETTE.
    
    PHI. (_to_ ARMANDE _and_ BÉLISE). At least, let us do him
    all the honours of our knowledge. (_To_ HENRIETTE, _who is
    going_) Stop! I told you very plainly that I wanted to speak to
    you.
    
    HEN. But what about?
    
    PHI. You will soon be enlightened on the subject.
    
    
    
    
    SCENE V.--TRISSOTIN, VADIUS, PHILAMINTE, BÉLISE, ARMANDE, HENRIETTE.
    
    TRI. (_introducing_ VADIUS). [Footnote: It is probably Ménage who
    is here laughed at.] Here is the gentleman who is dying to see you. In
    presenting him I am not afraid, Madam, of being accused of introducing
    a profane person to you; he can hold his place among the wits.
    
    PHI. The hand which introduces him sufficiently proves his value.
    
    TRI. He has a perfect knowledge of the ancient authors, and knows
    Greek, Madam, as well as any man in France.
    
    PHI. (_to_ BÉLISE). Greek! O heaven! Greek! He understands Greek,
    sister!
    
    BEL. (_to_ ARMANDE). Ah, niece! Greek!
    
    ARM. Greek! ah! how delightful!
    
    PHI. What, Sir, you understand Greek? Allow me, I beg, for the love of
    Greek, to embrace you. (VADIUS _embraces also_ BÉLISE _and_
    ARMANDE.)
    
    HEN. (_to_ VADIUS, _who comes forward to embrace her_)
    Excuse me, Sir, I do not understand Greek. (_They sit down_.)
    
    PHI. I have a wonderful respect for Greek books.
    
    VAD. I fear that the anxiety which calls me to render my homage to you
    to-day, Madam, may render me importunate. I may have disturbed some
    learned discourse.
    
    PHI. Sir, with Greek in possession, you can spoil nothing.
    
    TRI. Moreover, he does wonders in prose as well as in verse, and he
    could, if he chose, show you something.
    
    VAD. The fault of authors is to burden conversation with their
    productions; to be at the Palais, in the walks, in the drawing-rooms,
    or at table, the indefatigable readers of their tedious verses. As for
    me, I think nothing more ridiculous than an author who goes about
    begging for praise, who, preying on the ears of the first comers,
    often makes them the martyrs of his night watches. I have never been
    guilty of such foolish conceit, and I am in that respect of the
    opinion of a Greek, who by an express law forbade all his wise men any
    unbecoming anxiety to read their works.--Here are some little verses
    for young lovers upon which I should like to have your opinion.
    
    TRI. Your verses have beauties unequalled by any others.
    
    VAD. Venus and the Graces reign in all yours.</pre>
